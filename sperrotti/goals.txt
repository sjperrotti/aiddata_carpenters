What I hope to get out of this class:
	My goal for this class is to be able to feel comfortable using the computer programs that we are going to learn.  Not being a very computer savvy person, it can be difficult for me to pick up this kind of thing but I hope that at the end of the summer I can use these programs with relative ease.  I am particularly looking forward to learning how to use GIS and just basically have a better understanding of how to manipulate data.
